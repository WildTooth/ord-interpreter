# ord

## What is ord?

`ord` is an attempt at creating a simple but creative programming language.

## How does ord work?

In `ord`, there is no real reserved keywords. Instead, the language has some reserved letters that make up the identifiers of the instructions.
The language is designed to be "simple", with around 16 instructions, but not necessarily "easy" to use. For a detailed list of instructions, see the [documentation](documentation.md) page.

## What does "ord" mean?

The name `ord` is a very short descriptor for the language. Since the language is heavily based on words, the name
was chosen to reflect that. The word `ord` is actually just the danish word for "word."
